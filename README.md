# Wrangle and Analyze Data

This project demonstrates my data wrangling knowledge by working with three different data sources,
assessing the quality and tidiness. From the cleaned datasets a master data file is created.


This project was done as part of my enrollment in [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) program by [Udacity](https://udacity.com/)
